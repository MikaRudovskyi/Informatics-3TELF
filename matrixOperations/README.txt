### Title: Matrix Operations and Analysis

### Description

This C++ program performs various operations and checks on a 5x5 matrix. It includes the following functionalities:

1. Printing the Matrix: The function `printMatrix` prints the entire matrix.
2. Counting Zeros: The function `countZeros` counts and returns the number of zero elements in the matrix.
3. Summing the First Row: The function `sumFirstRow` calculates and returns the sum of the elements in the first row.
4. Center Symmetry Check: The function `checkCenterSymmetry` checks if the elements in the center column and center row are symmetric with respect to the matrix center.
5. Diagonal Symmetry Check: The function `checkDiagonalSymmetry` checks if the primary diagonal elements are symmetric with the secondary diagonal elements.

The `main` function initializes a matrix with random values between 0 and 9, prints the matrix, and then calls each of the defined functions to perform the specified operations and checks, displaying the results.
