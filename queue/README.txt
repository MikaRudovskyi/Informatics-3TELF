This code implements a simple ticket queue system using a circular array as the underlying data structure. Let's break down the main components:

1. Structures and Constants: 
    - `Ticket` struct represents individual tickets with attributes like number, owner, and time.
    - `Queue` struct represents the queue itself, containing members for head, tail, size, and an array of tickets. 
    - `N` is a macro constant representing the maximum capacity of the queue.

2. Function Definitions:
    - `initialize`: Initializes the queue by setting head, tail, and size to -1 and 0 respectively.
    - `printLine`: Utility function to print a line of equal signs for visual separation.
    - `showMenu`: Displays the menu options for interacting with the ticket queue.
    - `addTicket`: Allows adding a new ticket to the queue, prompting the user for ticket details and handling queue full condition.
    - `removeTicket`: Removes a ticket from the queue, displaying its details and updating head and size.
    - `showQueue`: Displays all the tickets in the queue, iterating through the circular array.

3. Main Function:
    - `main`: Initializes the queue, enters a loop to display the menu and handle user choices until the user chooses to exit. The loop uses a switch statement to call appropriate functions based on user input.

Overall, this code provides a basic interactive interface for managing a ticket queue, allowing users to add tickets, remove tickets, and view all the tickets currently in the queue.
